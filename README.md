My 42 Piscine Journey
=====================

About 42
--------

42 is a groundbreaking and completely free coding school. With no traditional lectures or teachers, it offers a learning experience based on projects, teamwork, and self-education. Students learn to code, collaborate, and creatively and efficiently solve complex problems.

The Piscine
-----------

The "Piscine" is an intense and rigorous immersion process lasting about a month. During this period, students dive into the world of coding and must complete a series of challenges and projects, primarily in the C language. It's a critical time where students learn the fundamentals of programming and develop essential problem-solving skills.
